        " ### Variable âœ…\n",
        "In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that represents or refers to a value. It is a way to store and manipulate data in your programs. Unlike some other programming languages, you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable in Python; the interpreter determines the type based on the value assigned to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how you can declare and use variables in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Variable Declaration and Assignment:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Assigning an integer value to a variable\n",
        "age = 25\n",
        "\n",
        "# Assigning a string value to a variable\n",
        "name = \"John\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Assigning a floating-point value to a variable\n",
        "height = 5.9\n",
        "\n",
        "# Assigning a boolean value to a variable\n",
        "is_student = True\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Variable Naming Rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Variable names in Python can contain letters (both lowercase and uppercase), digits, and underscores.\n",
        "- They cannot start with a digit.\n",
        "- Python is case-sensitive, so `age` and `Age` are different variables.\n",
        "- Avoid using reserved words (keywords) like `if`, `else`, `while`, etc., as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reassignment and Dynamic Typing:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 10\n",
        "print(x)  # Output: 10\n",
        "\n",
        "x = \"Hello\"\n",
        "print(x)  # Output: Hello\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you can change the type of the variable by assigning a new value of a different type to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Multiple Assignment:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can assign values to multiple variables in a single line:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "a, b, c = 1, 2, 3\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Constants:\n",
        "\n",
        "Although Python doesn't have a strict concept of constants, developers often use uppercase names for variables whose values should not be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "PI = 3.14\n",
        "GRAVITY = 9.8\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Using Variables in Operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Performing operations with variables\n",
        "result = age + 5\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 30\n",

        "print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, John\n",

        "### Type Conversion:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can convert variables from one type to another using type conversion functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "num_str = \"42\"\n",
        "num_int = int(num_str)\n",
